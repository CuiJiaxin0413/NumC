# numc

### Overview
-  Developed a high-performance version of NumPy in C, leveraging the Python-C interface and optimizing with SIMD, OpenMP, and cache blockingâ€”resulting in a staggering 1300x speed increase in matrix operations.
- Engineered core functionalities including addition, multiplication, absolute value computation, power operations, and advanced matrix slicing for both rows and columns.
- Ensured software robustness by authoring comprehensive unit tests, achieving a branch coverage of 100%.

### Documentation

#### Summary
`numc` is a libarary using for basic matrix calculation operations. Numc is implemented by Python-C interface. Numc provides extremely efficient operations for matrix. Numc supports matrix addition, matrix multiplication, absolute matrix calculation and power calculation. Numc also supports matrix slicing, getting a value from ith row jth col of a matrix, and setting a value at ith row jth col of a matrix. 

To use `numc`:
```python
>>> import numc as nc
```
And you will see,
```
CS61C Summer 2021 Project 4: numc imported!
